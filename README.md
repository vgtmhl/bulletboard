# Bulletboard

Bulletboard application made with Redux-Toolkit and Typescript
The goal of this application is to showcase the structure and syntax of a modern Redux application as suggested by the redux devs.

This is a Typescript implementation of Dave Gray's Javascript tutorial: [React Redux Example Project with Redux Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hI-VgEaCMyQ&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M1J5I1w2-uZx36Qp6qhjKo&index=2)
